                    You are cordially invited to attend the <strong>2022 Family Reunion</strong>. We have a variety of activities planned throughout the weekend. Come enjoy food, family, and fun as we celebrate each other and our family heritage. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The registration fee for the family reunion is $100 per person. This will include food, beverage, and activities during all scheduled events. Children under 3 do not require a registration fee. There are family reunion t-shirts available to purchase for the event. Fees and t-shirt purchases can be made through the event coordinator.                </p>
                <p>
                    Our reunion will kick off with the <em>“Life's a Beach”</em> party. The family will enjoy a Meet & Greet with food, beverages, and beach activities. Everyone is encouraged to be in attendance. Don't forget to bring sunblock! Weekend events will also include a family BBQ in the beautiful Balboa Park. There will be a bouncy house and inflatable water slide available for the kids to enjoy. We'll also have an after-hours adult mixer after the children are put to bed. There will be a brunch send-off party on Sunday where we can enjoy breakfast and mimosas on the patio where you can share contact information with relatives, if you haven’t already.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will have photo booth setup throughout the weekend to capture memories as we celebrate. This will be a great way to reconnect with close and distant relatives. 
                </p>
